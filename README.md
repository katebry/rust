# Rust

Going through and trying the exercises in the rust lang book ðŸ¦€ðŸ“š

`rustc main.rs` to compile the code 

`Cargo` is rust's build system and package manager



`cargo new <whatever>` creates a new project

`cargo run` compiles then runs the generated executable (path to exe is `./target/debug/<whatever>`)

`cargo check` checks if your code compiles but doesn't produce an executable
