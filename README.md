# Rust

### Going through the exercises in the [rust lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) ü¶Äüìö

### Cargo commands

`cargo new <whatever>` creates a new project

`cargo run` compiles then runs the generated executable (path to exe is `./target/debug/<whatever>`)

`cargo check` checks if your code compiles but doesn't produce an executable

`cargo build --release` compiles your code with optimisations (path to exe is `./target/release/<whatever>`)

`cargo doc --open` to build documentation based on your dependencies

### Useful info 

- variables are immutable by default, to make a variable mutable you have to use `mut` üê∂
- `const`(ants) are always immutable, naming convention is to use all caps, e.g. `const USE_ALL_CAPS: String`
- variables declared with `let` can be shadowed üëª, e.g. `let x = 5; let x = x + 1` in this case, the end value of `x` is 6 
- rust is a statically typed language, which means it must know the types of all variables at compile time
- rust has 4 primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans and characters
- unsigned numbers are positive üòäüòÑü§ó (and have a `u` in the typing)
- `char` literals use single quotes, whilst string literals use double: `let response = "they do indeed"`
- rust has two primitive compound types, `tuples` and `arrays` - tuples have a fixed length, once declared they cannot grow or shrink in size & they can contain a mixture of types
- arrays have a fixed length, every element of the array must be of the same type
- rust is an expression based language üëÑüí¨ (expressions evaluate to a resultant value)
- expressions do not include ending semicolons - if you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement & it will not return a value
- a slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership
- a struct is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group - a struct is like an object's data attributes
- all functions defined within an `impl` block are called *associated functions* because they're associated with the type named after the `impl`
- *binary crates* are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run
- *library crates* don't have a main function and they don't compile to an executable (this type of crate is also known as a *library*)
- a *package* is a bundle of one or more crates, it contains a *Cargo.toml* file that describes how to build said crates
- code within a module is private by default
- you should use *idiomatic `use` paths* - that means specifying the parent module when calling the function to make it clear that the function being used isn't locally defined
- when bringing in `structs` and `enums` however, you can specify the full path, e.g. `use std::collections::HashMap;` then within your function you can call `HashMap::<whatever>`
- you can use the `glob` operator to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, e.g. `use std::collections::*;`
- when creating new Vectors, you can use the `vec!` macro, e.g. `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`
- many of the same operations available with `Vec<T>` are available with `String` as well because `String` is implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions and capabilities
- you can use `contains` for searching in a string and `replace` for substituting parts of a string with another string
- all values and keys within a `hashmap` must have the same type
- rust has two types of errors: `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro for unrecoverable errors

### Ownership

The main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data

1. Each value in Rust has an *owner*
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
